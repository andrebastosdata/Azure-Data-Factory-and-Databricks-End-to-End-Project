# Azure Data Factory and Databricks End-to-End Project

## **Project Description**

This end-to-end Azure data engineering project demonstrates how **Azure Data Factory (ADF)** and **Azure Databricks** can be utilized to process and analyze a trip transactions dataset stored in **SQL Server**. The goal is to enable businesses to harness the power of cloud-based data integration and transformation, unlocking actionable intelligence for strategic decision-making.

The project employs the **medallion architecture** (bronze, silver, and gold layers) to ensure a structured and organized data flow. Insights derived from the data include customer behavior patterns, top-rated drivers, and trip frequency analysis, which are pivotal for optimizing operations and enhancing customer satisfaction.

## **Business Objective**

- Use **ADF** to replicate raw data into the **bronze layer**.
- Process and transform the data using **Azure Databricks**, storing the results in the **silver zone** in Delta format.
- Prepare curated datasets in the **gold layer** for analytics and visualization.
- Demonstrate advanced **Delta Lake** features, including **time travel**, **schema evolution**, and **cloning**.

## **Key Components**

### **1. Azure Data Factory (ADF)**
- Ingests data from SQL Server and moves it to **Azure Blob Storage**.
- Orchestrates workflows using pipelines and data flows.
- Enables integration with GitHub for **CI/CD** and version control.

### **2. Azure Databricks**
- Processes and transforms data in **Delta format**.
- Manages clusters for efficient **Apache Spark** processing.
- Facilitates collaboration using **notebooks** and **Git integration**.

### **3. Delta Lake**
- Provides advanced data management with features like **time travel** and **schema evolution**.
- Enables structured data storage in **bronze**, **silver**, and **gold layers**.

### **4. Power BI**
- Connects to **gold-layer datasets** for visualization.
- Delivers insights into customer behavior and operational efficiency.

## **Approach**

1. **Data Ingestion:**  
   - Use ADF to replicate data from SQL Server to **Azure Blob Storage (bronze layer)**.

2. **Data Transformation:**  
   - Transform raw data using Databricks and save it in the **silver layer** in Delta format.

3. **Advanced Features:**  
   - Implement Delta Lake capabilities for robust data management.

4. **Visualization:**  
   - Load curated datasets into Power BI to extract meaningful insights.

## **How to Run the Project**

1. **Set up Azure Services:**
   - Create Azure Data Factory, Databricks, and Blob Storage instances.
2. **Ingest Data:**
   - Configure ADF pipelines to move raw data to the bronze layer.
3. **Process Data:**
   - Use Databricks notebooks to clean, transform, and store data in silver and gold layers.
4. **Visualize:**
   - Connect Power BI to gold-layer datasets for analytics.
